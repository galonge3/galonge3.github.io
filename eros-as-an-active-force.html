<p>Long before Plato, indeed, long before even the pre-Socratics, Hesiod’s Theogony declared Eros as one of the four principal deities responsible for shaping our universe.  He considered it to be the fairest of the deities, responsible for our sexual desire and urge to reproduce[1].  By the time Plato takes on the topic it has changed slightly, but what's clear, is that Eros was a pervasive concept that garnered thought and reverence from the greatest of thinkers.  Plato, through Socrates, discusses Eros in his dialogue, <em>Phaedrus</em>.  A dynamic dialogue, <em>Phaedrus</em> focuses on philosophical communication by using Eros as the subject matter.  For the scope of this piece, I will be outlining how Plato defines Eros, and how he suggests it interacts with our lives.  As I do so, I will also be highlighting how Plato’s description of Eros thus renders it an active force in the Nietzschean will to power dynamic.
    It is in Socrates’ famous second speech that the concept of Eros is outlined and is thus made clear to be an active force in the will to power.  He does this by equating love to a blessed madness and then describing the derivation of this madness.  To do this, he employs a grand metaphor that goes as follows: all souls are a pair of two horses, and one charioteer at the reins.  All gods are composed of two beautiful, strong and disciplined horses; while all mortal souls have one good horse, and one bad horse.  For us mortals, our souls constantly struggle with our one bad horse.  Before going further, we must define the Nietzschean will to power.  According to Gilles Deleuze, “We know that the will to power is the differential element, the genealogical element which determines the relation of force with force...” (62).  Here, we see the ‘differential element’ in the two contrasting horses of the mortal souls.  The two horses are like opposing forces, the strong horse as an active force, and the weak horse as the reactive force.  Through our discussion of Eros, we will see this interplay between the two forces play out, thus rendering it a will to power[2].<br>
    Socrates declares that all souls belong to the heavens, and initially exist in winged disembodied states.  In their original state, these souls patrol the heavens, feasting on beauty, truth, and piety.  However, when these souls are starved of their nourishment, their wings begin to die and fall off.  So where do they find such sustenance?  Socrates explains this by using captivating imagery.  He tells us that in the realm of the heavens, there lies an elevation which leads to the summit of the heavens[3].  In one tragic procession, the gods lead the way and quickly ascend the mighty elevation and feast on the nourishment that lies in the grasses beyond the heavens.  Following the gods are the mortal souls, who have a more difficult time ascending the elevation, for their ugly horse makes the journey cumbersome.  Only the skilled charioteer who can manage his bad horse can reach the summit.  Even so, once at the summit, the ugly horse occasionally jerks the charioteer away from viewing the beyond heaven.  None the less, this charioteer still gets to see some aspects of the beyond, and his horses get adequate nourishment from it.  Last in the procession of heavenly souls are the mortal souls who cannot control their sick horses.  The repugnant horse is winning the struggle, and thus, these chariots are never able to summit.  Not only are these souls struggling with their bad horse, but they are also fighting with other defeated souls.  As a result, they never feast on the truth and beauty that lies beyond the heavens, and instead nourish themselves with petty opinions, superstition, and conjecture.  Thus, their wings begin to die off, and they fall to earth where they attach to a physical body.  Here we see that all souls are a will to power composed of an interplay between differing forces.  The active force is the strong horse, while the reactive force is the weak horse.  In the gods, there is no duality of differential forces because they are gods.  For the mortals, only those who are god-like (Übermenschen) realize a dominance of active forces and submission of reactive forces.  The mortals whose souls never reach the summit have a will to power in which the reactive forces disintegrate the active forces, thus becoming defeated by baseness.  Deleuze outlines this when he says, “But an inferior force can bring about disintegration or splitting of superior forces…” (63)  Crucially, this still defines a will to power, but this will to power is now slavish, just as the defeated mortal soul is a slave to the vile horse.
    However, what does Eros have to do with an interplay of the soul?  Well, Eros is an active force.  It is one of the beautiful truths that lie beyond heaven visible from the summit.  Indeed, it is the most beautiful of all truths and shines radiantly.  Philosophically speaking, it is one of Plato’s forms, all of which lie here, beyond the heavens.  These forms are eternally true essences.  For Plato, everything has an essence, and when we experience a thing on earth, we are merely experiencing the representation of that essence.  Moreover, the form exists with or without the representation of it.  Recall that our souls began as winged spirits of the heaven who feasted upon the forms beyond heaven.  Therefore, when we experience an essence on earth, we remember the experience of that essence in the beyond heaven—an experience that we have not been nourished by since our time as winged chariots.  Therefore, when we experience true beauty, we are jolted back to a recollection of the magnificent form of Eros.  This puts us in a state of awe.  Our poor, debilitated souls are stricken with terror, just as suffocating lungs violently gasp for air when relieved.  The experience pulls us out of our dark cave—a cave we thought constituted our entire reality.  It connects us to a beauty we forgot existed, leading us to the light beyond the cave entrance[4].  In this moment of recognition, he who undergoes this experience is, “...reminded of true beauty...and he gazes aloft, like a bird, paying no attention to what is down below—and that is what brings on him the charge that he has gone mad” (37).  This is why being in love is a blessed madness.  Ultimately, this blessed madness is an active force which seeks to dominate the soul of the lover.  However, what is the reactive force which aims to destroy the active Eros?  Chaos.  Chaos is the reactive and submissive force which dances in the duality, and insidiously threatens the dominance of Eros in the will to power.  Which is appropriate, for the father of Eros in the Theogony is chaos, another principle deity in Hesiod's cosmogony.
    The chaotic force is outlined in Lysias’ speech.  In his speech, Lysius presents the soul of the lover as having been consumed by the reactive force of chaos.  Thus, Lysius paints the lover as a slave to his own base desires and interests, as someone who has lost all control.  This base lover is selfish, possessive and hedonistic.  He does not want what is best for the beloved; rather, he wants his animal flesh to be satisfied at the certain expense of the beloved’s well-being.  This is because the reactive chaos has overwhelmed the active Eros, and “[w]hen reactive force separates active force from what it can do, the latter also becomes reactive.  <em>Active forces become reactive</em>” (Deleuze, 64).  Thus degrading the active force of Eros into a reactive force of greedy obsession—the pathetic version of itself.  The strong horse of our soul has been turned into the wretched horse in our will to power.
    Socrates acknowledges this danger that the lover faces.  He recognizes that every soul is nothing more than a will to power, where active forces battle reactive forces for dominance.  However, for Socrates, just as on the path to philosophy, the path to true love, is one in which beauty overcomes chaos.  The chaos remains, just like our ugly horse, but it is now submissive and tractable again.  It is now contained enough to ascend the heavenly elevation, thus affording the charioteer “Another becoming, another sensibility: the overman” (Deleuze, 65).
    It is now time to outline the experience of the lover and the beloved when their wills to power encounter these forces.  According to Plato, beauty, and thus the forces it generates, engages the soul via our eyes.  The lover sees beauty gleaming in a beautiful person.  This is the moment when the lover undergoes his profound recollection of beauty’s essence, affecting a sharp pain.  It is the pain of his soul’s wings beginning to grow back, and from here on, the lover is caught in the rapture of the beloved’s physical beauty.  The lover cannot stop thinking about his beloved, so he seeks her out at every possible opportunity.  When the lover is with his beloved, he feels the intense mollification of his painful abscesses where wings once were.  Conversely, when he is away from his beloved, the pain becomes unbearable.  Only the vision and presence of his beloved can adequately soothe his agony.  Thus, even the potential of encountering his beloved stokes a frenzy within him that reverberates through his entire soul.  Each time he sees her, his chariot is violently pulled toward her by his untamed horse of chaos.  His vile horse bucks in a fury, and throws the charioteer off the chariot.  The force of the ugly horse has brought the chariot to within inches of the beloved’s face.  The charioteer, in awe of the pure beauty before him, is overcome with terror, and in so being, realizes a superhuman strength.  In an epic struggle, the charioteer bloodies and injures the ignoble horse to such an extent, that it finally submits.  It relents to the charioteer.  The active force has dominated the reactive force in the lover’s will to power.  Now the lover has regained control, and in so doing, can share his love with his beloved in a way that elevates them both to the gods, thus following the gods to the summit of the heavens, and nourishing their souls on the manna of the forms.  “This is the experience we humans call love…” (41)
    As for the beloved, she notices her lover’s gaze upon her, but is initially reticent, for she must wait to see how her lover’s will to power manifests itself in its sensibility.  Eventually, when the active Eros of the lover has prevailed over the reactive chaos, she begins to notice the controlled elation signified in the lover’s eyes.  She sees these essences within him, and she becomes overtaken by her own will to power.  She begins to fall in love with the reflection of enchantment incandescent in the lover’s eyes.  She is caught up in the form of beauty as it shines upon her representation of it.  Eventually, she desires to spend more time with the lover, and she slowly begins to feel the active force of Eros overcome her soul as well.  When it finally does, she embraces the lover in a physical celebration of the most beautiful essence known in the cosmos.  The two become inseparable as they ascend the hierarchy of souls, reaching ever closer to the gods.  Such is Eros.  Two Übermenschen who’s souls continually and perpetually lift one another up in an eternal return of their respective affirming wills to power.  “...their life here below is one of bliss and shared understanding” (Phaedrus, 47)[5].</p>
