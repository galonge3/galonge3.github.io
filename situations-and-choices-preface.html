Why did Jean-Paul Sartre choose to write <em>Anti-Semite</em> and <em>Jew</em> in 1945?  Because he was pissed off.  He was angry at his native France for ignoring the problem.  At the conclusion of WWII, France was focusing on the positive, while trying to rebuild Europe.  Apparently, nobody wanted to broach the subject of millions of Jews being exterminated—but he did.  He felt obligated to explain to the population how and why anti-Semitism exists.  As a Jew myself, his words had an enormous impact on me, as he explained to me why my people have historically been scapegoated and discriminated.  He does this by breaking down the type of person who would choose to live with such extreme hatred.  His breakdown is outlined in my essay.</p>
<p>This breakdown shook the medical student Frantz Fanon to his core.  For the first time in his life, someone was sensibly explaining to him the nature of hatred and the type of person who harbors it.  However, while Fanon was captivated, he felt slightly unsatisfied.  Why?  Because Jews are essentially white people, so they are difficult to distinguish.  Black people like Fanon, on the other hand, could never blend into the white crowd. Therefore, the relentless hatred thrown his way was constant and debilitating.  That is why he wrote his book, Black Skins, White Masks in 1952.  It focuses on how black people live the experience of overwhelming racism, simply because their skin sets them starkly apart from the ruling white race.  </p>
<p>I wrote this essay for people who study philosophy and history; however, I believe there is something to be gained by all readers.</p>
