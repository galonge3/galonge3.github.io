&lt;p&gt;Long before Plato, indeed, long before even the pre-Socratics, Hesiod’s Theogony declared Eros as one of the four principal deities responsible for shaping our universe.  He considered it to be the fairest of the deities, responsible for our sexual desire and urge to reproduce[1].  By the time Plato takes on the topic it has changed slightly, but what's clear, is that Eros was a pervasive concept that garnered thought and reverence from the greatest of thinkers.  Plato, through Socrates, discusses Eros in his dialogue, &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt;.  A dynamic dialogue, &lt;em&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/em&gt; focuses on philosophical communication by using Eros as the subject matter.  For the scope of this piece, I will be outlining how Plato defines Eros, and how he suggests it interacts with our lives.  As I do so, I will also be highlighting how Plato’s description of Eros thus renders it an active force in the Nietzschean will to power dynamic.
    It is in Socrates’ famous second speech that the concept of Eros is outlined and is thus made clear to be an active force in the will to power.  He does this by equating love to a blessed madness and then describing the derivation of this madness.  To do this, he employs a grand metaphor that goes as follows: all souls are a pair of two horses, and one charioteer at the reins.  All gods are composed of two beautiful, strong and disciplined horses; while all mortal souls have one good horse, and one bad horse.  For us mortals, our souls constantly struggle with our one bad horse.  Before going further, we must define the Nietzschean will to power.  According to Gilles Deleuze, “We know that the will to power is the differential element, the genealogical element which determines the relation of force with force...” (62).  Here, we see the ‘differential element’ in the two contrasting horses of the mortal souls.  The two horses are like opposing forces, the strong horse as an active force, and the weak horse as the reactive force.  Through our discussion of Eros, we will see this interplay between the two forces play out, thus rendering it a will to power[2].&lt;br&gt;
    Socrates declares that all souls belong to the heavens, and initially exist in winged disembodied states.  In their original state, these souls patrol the heavens, feasting on beauty, truth, and piety.  However, when these souls are starved of their nourishment, their wings begin to die and fall off.  So where do they find such sustenance?  Socrates explains this by using captivating imagery.  He tells us that in the realm of the heavens, there lies an elevation which leads to the summit of the heavens[3].  In one tragic procession, the gods lead the way and quickly ascend the mighty elevation and feast on the nourishment that lies in the grasses beyond the heavens.  Following the gods are the mortal souls, who have a more difficult time ascending the elevation, for their ugly horse makes the journey cumbersome.  Only the skilled charioteer who can manage his bad horse can reach the summit.  Even so, once at the summit, the ugly horse occasionally jerks the charioteer away from viewing the beyond heaven.  None the less, this charioteer still gets to see some aspects of the beyond, and his horses get adequate nourishment from it.  Last in the procession of heavenly souls are the mortal souls who cannot control their sick horses.  The repugnant horse is winning the struggle, and thus, these chariots are never able to summit.  Not only are these souls struggling with their bad horse, but they are also fighting with other defeated souls.  As a result, they never feast on the truth and beauty that lies beyond the heavens, and instead nourish themselves with petty opinions, superstition, and conjecture.  Thus, their wings begin to die off, and they fall to earth where they attach to a physical body.  Here we see that all souls are a will to power composed of an interplay between differing forces.  The active force is the strong horse, while the reactive force is the weak horse.  In the gods, there is no duality of differential forces because they are gods.  For the mortals, only those who are god-like (Übermenschen) realize a dominance of active forces and submission of reactive forces.  The mortals whose souls never reach the summit have a will to power in which the reactive forces disintegrate the active forces, thus becoming defeated by baseness.  Deleuze outlines this when he says, “But an inferior force can bring about disintegration or splitting of superior forces…” (63)  Crucially, this still defines a will to power, but this will to power is now slavish, just as the defeated mortal soul is a slave to the vile horse.
    However, what does Eros have to do with an interplay of the soul?  Well, Eros is an active force.  It is one of the beautiful truths that lie beyond heaven visible from the summit.  Indeed, it is the most beautiful of all truths and shines radiantly.  Philosophically speaking, it is one of Plato’s forms, all of which lie here, beyond the heavens.  These forms are eternally true essences.  For Plato, everything has an essence, and when we experience a thing on earth, we are merely experiencing the representation of that essence.  Moreover, the form exists with or without the representation of it.  Recall that our souls began as winged spirits of the heaven who feasted upon the forms beyond heaven.  Therefore, when we experience an essence on earth, we remember the experience of that essence in the beyond heaven—an experience that we have not been nourished by since our time as winged chariots.  Therefore, when we experience true beauty, we are jolted back to a recollection of the magnificent form of Eros.  This puts us in a state of awe.  Our poor, debilitated souls are stricken with terror, just as suffocating lungs violently gasp for air when relieved.  The experience pulls us out of our dark cave—a cave we thought constituted our entire reality.  It connects us to a beauty we forgot existed, leading us to the light beyond the cave entrance[4].  In this moment of recognition, he who undergoes this experience is, “...reminded of true beauty...and he gazes aloft, like a bird, paying no attention to what is down below—and that is what brings on him the charge that he has gone mad” (37).  This is why being in love is a blessed madness.  Ultimately, this blessed madness is an active force which seeks to dominate the soul of the lover.  However, what is the reactive force which aims to destroy the active Eros?  Chaos.  Chaos is the reactive and submissive force which dances in the duality, and insidiously threatens the dominance of Eros in the will to power.  Which is appropriate, for the father of Eros in the Theogony is chaos, another principle deity in Hesiod's cosmogony.
    The chaotic force is outlined in Lysias’ speech.  In his speech, Lysius presents the soul of the lover as having been consumed by the reactive force of chaos.  Thus, Lysius paints the lover as a slave to his own base desires and interests, as someone who has lost all control.  This base lover is selfish, possessive and hedonistic.  He does not want what is best for the beloved; rather, he wants his animal flesh to be satisfied at the certain expense of the beloved’s well-being.  This is because the reactive chaos has overwhelmed the active Eros, and “[w]hen reactive force separates active force from what it can do, the latter also becomes reactive.  &lt;em&gt;Active forces become reactive&lt;/em&gt;” (Deleuze, 64).  Thus degrading the active force of Eros into a reactive force of greedy obsession—the pathetic version of itself.  The strong horse of our soul has been turned into the wretched horse in our will to power.
    Socrates acknowledges this danger that the lover faces.  He recognizes that every soul is nothing more than a will to power, where active forces battle reactive forces for dominance.  However, for Socrates, just as on the path to philosophy, the path to true love, is one in which beauty overcomes chaos.  The chaos remains, just like our ugly horse, but it is now submissive and tractable again.  It is now contained enough to ascend the heavenly elevation, thus affording the charioteer “Another becoming, another sensibility: the overman” (Deleuze, 65).
    It is now time to outline the experience of the lover and the beloved when their wills to power encounter these forces.  According to Plato, beauty, and thus the forces it generates, engages the soul via our eyes.  The lover sees beauty gleaming in a beautiful person.  This is the moment when the lover undergoes his profound recollection of beauty’s essence, affecting a sharp pain.  It is the pain of his soul’s wings beginning to grow back, and from here on, the lover is caught in the rapture of the beloved’s physical beauty.  The lover cannot stop thinking about his beloved, so he seeks her out at every possible opportunity.  When the lover is with his beloved, he feels the intense mollification of his painful abscesses where wings once were.  Conversely, when he is away from his beloved, the pain becomes unbearable.  Only the vision and presence of his beloved can adequately soothe his agony.  Thus, even the potential of encountering his beloved stokes a frenzy within him that reverberates through his entire soul.  Each time he sees her, his chariot is violently pulled toward her by his untamed horse of chaos.  His vile horse bucks in a fury, and throws the charioteer off the chariot.  The force of the ugly horse has brought the chariot to within inches of the beloved’s face.  The charioteer, in awe of the pure beauty before him, is overcome with terror, and in so being, realizes a superhuman strength.  In an epic struggle, the charioteer bloodies and injures the ignoble horse to such an extent, that it finally submits.  It relents to the charioteer.  The active force has dominated the reactive force in the lover’s will to power.  Now the lover has regained control, and in so doing, can share his love with his beloved in a way that elevates them both to the gods, thus following the gods to the summit of the heavens, and nourishing their souls on the manna of the forms.  “This is the experience we humans call love…” (41)
    As for the beloved, she notices her lover’s gaze upon her, but is initially reticent, for she must wait to see how her lover’s will to power manifests itself in its sensibility.  Eventually, when the active Eros of the lover has prevailed over the reactive chaos, she begins to notice the controlled elation signified in the lover’s eyes.  She sees these essences within him, and she becomes overtaken by her own will to power.  She begins to fall in love with the reflection of enchantment incandescent in the lover’s eyes.  She is caught up in the form of beauty as it shines upon her representation of it.  Eventually, she desires to spend more time with the lover, and she slowly begins to feel the active force of Eros overcome her soul as well.  When it finally does, she embraces the lover in a physical celebration of the most beautiful essence known in the cosmos.  The two become inseparable as they ascend the hierarchy of souls, reaching ever closer to the gods.  Such is Eros.  Two Übermenschen who’s souls continually and perpetually lift one another up in an eternal return of their respective affirming wills to power.  “...their life here below is one of bliss and shared understanding” (Phaedrus, 47)[5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1. “In knowledge too, I feel only my will’s joy in procreating and becoming; and if there is innocence in my knowledge, it is because the will to procreation is in it” (Zarathustra II “On Blissful Isles”).&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2. The will to power is often confused for a desire to dominate.  This, in the case of the Nietzschean concept, is a common and gross misinterpretation, the reasoning behind which goes beyond the scope of this project.
&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3. “From afar we can hardly see the summit” (Deleuze, 71)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4. Plato’s &lt;i&gt;Allegory of the Cave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5.  For, “... [their] will always comes to [them] as [their] liberator and comforter.  Willing liberates: that is the true teaching of will and freedom…” (Zarathustra II “On Blissful Isles”)

&lt;i&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;“If the people of the world are plunged into yet another world war, the result will be that the Jews will take over even more” (Hitler, Jan 31st, 1941, right before Germany declared war on the Soviet Union).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre sees it, life centers around the choices we are free to make, and the situation from which we make those choices.  A Sartrean situation is the amalgamation of uncontrollable circumstances a person finds herself in, like her age, height, and yes, race.  According to the French philosopher and playwright, a human being is her situation, combined with her choices.  Each choice she is presented with is an opportunity to create her path and shape her future from within her given situation.  But once she makes a choice, her decision is spot welded into her fixed situation.  All people choose what they want their lives to look like based on what their lives are not, and they choose their futures within the confines of their situation[1].  For example, the anti-Semite chooses to experience the world-view of a racist; and his situation—his age, genetic code, etc.—is incidental.  In his thrashing 1945 book, Anti-Semite and Jew, Sartre chooses to focus on the choices the anti-Semite makes, and the experience that follows from those choices.  Each decision rendered, effects ourselves, those around us, and the society at large, thus exposing the immense responsibility, and anguish[2] of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us to understand the chosen experience of the anti-Semite, we must first understand how the racist sees others around him.  We must uncover how he looks at the people in his frame of view at any one moment.  For Sartre, a large part of our situation is defined by how we are gazed upon, so, when the anti-Semite looks at a person, he, like everybody else, is partially determining that person’s situation.  If looked upon as Jewish, you are in the situation of a Jew.  If seen as black, you are in the situation of a black person.  The anti-Semite, who has chosen to scan for Jews and outsiders, looks out into the world and identifies a figure.  He then decides: Jew, or not Jew—one is either or.  Immediately thereafter, he deciphers: Frenchman, or not Frenchman—one is either or.  The bigot polarizes his vision via a black and white lexicon.  One of good vs. evil, Jew vs. non-Jew.  He evaluates with the nonsense of intuition, and stupidity of hatred and anger.  A ‘logic of passion.’  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passion of cowardice he has chosen for himself and indulged to the fullest extent.  All passions are choices, but most are positive, like love and art.  The passion of anti-Semitism, on the other hand, is a negative passion of hatred, destruction, and rejection.  The racist’s negation assuages his hatred and justifies the mediocrity he has also chosen.  He has full control over his passion, as choices are tractable.  A member of the herd, the anti-Semite elects to be average, and thus takes refuge in comfort and ease.  His passion for mediocrity depends on his choice to be solid, stupid and stone-like.  Impenetrable and irrational to the point of delusion; because to be flexible, would require self-reflection—the very reflection he flees.  In choosing this experience, he runs away from his own contingency and responsibility.  He runs and hides from the fact that the world which does not need him, still requires responsibility of the choices thrust upon him.  In the reflection of the world’s indifference, the anti-Semite looks upon himself most vividly, and in his clairvoyance, chooses to deny.  He flees his consciousness, and thus existence[3].  He chooses to negate all other choices.  The cowardly racist denies himself, and in so doing, denies humanity—alas!  He still cannot escape the very anguish he originally fled.  He is a fearful and trembling[4] profile of his own shadow soaked in ressentiment[5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While falling into the abyss, the anti-Semite experiences the true indifference of the society.  He chooses to construct his own society in a fashion that accommodates his escape.  He chooses aristocracy.  This affords him free-superiority.  He has reified his status and encased it in a magical and timeless forcefield.  His preference for pre-revolution ways protects his mediocrity, and most importantly, his fearful escape from contingency and responsibility.  He chooses to construct a ‘pure’ and ‘righteous’ society, granting him the excuse to alienate and otherize.  His social construction is the barbiturate consciously taken to treat the anguish—the anguish that Sartre puts front and center throughout all his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After picking up and absorbing Sartre’s Jew, the Martinican, Frantz Fanon, was inspired to write his own book in 1952, entitled, Black skins, White Masks.  In chapter five, “The Lived Experience of the Black Man,” instead of focusing on the choices a person makes as Sartre’s had, Fanon, focuses on the horrifying phenomenology of the black man.  His blackness induces this dreadful consciousness, which can only be excised with a full peel back of the skin from the flesh.  A white mask will not suffice.  The horrifying nature of the black man’s situation places it in the foreground of his lived experience.  Thus, Fanon redefines ontology as a structure shaped by the Sartrean look, which imposes a wretched lived experience and lays the stage for the choices we need to make freely.  Therefore, Fanon’s existence is dictated by an apparatus built from his oppressed situation.  This apparatus projects distinct looks onto him, which force him to choose his actions in the face of these hallucinogenic visuals.  This myopic schema comprises the lived experience of Frantz Fanon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first look that Fanon receives as a black man is the white gaze.  It is a look of racism, which dehumanizes the colonized body, and dehumanizes Fanon with his penetrating gaze that objectifies[6], robbing him of the meaning he covets. 
Now, flayed open by the scalpel of the Eyes and exposed to the torrid radiation of the white gaze, his carcass is re-animated with savagery, cannibalism, fetishism and gaping white eyes.  The white man paints a grin on the wretched formation.  A shriek from the Other: 
“He’s scaring me, mama!” 
The white mass increases their distance but continues to stare.  Sensing solitude, Fanon hits the ground.  Manifest flesh and sinew covered by his own shadow—his back burns in the sun.  He shivers as he broils.  He chokes on the breathing room.  He sees the comedy and lives the tragedy.  The crowd stands at a distance, looking upon the figure with consternation, who collapses.  The crowd bolts, and once gone, the vultures circle overhead.
A lone woman enters Fanon’s field of perception.  Their eyes fasten—this look is different from the one the crowd had offered.  She comes over, picks him up off the ground, and helps him lick his wounds. 
“You see!”  She says, “Just because you’re a handsome Negro is no reason to fear you.” 
“The handsome Negro says, ‘Fuck you,’ Madame” (94). 
Her countenance tightens.  His blackness shouts through her vision—he sees her seeing it.  She runs away with the rest of them, and Fanon hits the ground again, but this time harboring a guttural roar.  Alone again, night descends, and he looks over himself.  One must imagine Fanon happy.[7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He starts back for the town but knows that his undeniable blackness will spot him in a hurry.  He sees a Jewish brother crawling past.  The strophe calls out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brother.  Won’t they see you?” 
“Maybe.”  The antistrophe calls back. 
“What about me?” 
“You?  You are black.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanon retreats and finds a wide gorge with rock enclaves splintering the earth.  Shelter for the evening.  There, he sees three other black men.  Not in person, but their thetics on the escarpments.  Written in a blue brought from the ocean and red risen from the earth, it reads: ‘Négritude.’  Fanon looks at the missives.  He reads, dissects, and rereads them.  Backward.  He is distrustful.  These colorful words look back at him in yet a third distinct fashion.  His eyes wide open and feet bare on the terrain, an empyreal rhythm establishes between him, the paints, and cosmos.  Grounded and free.  Mind and body reunified—this experience is compelling.  The poetic opium stirs his passion.  “This! —is verse.”  A sensitive verse yet to breathe warm air into the cold and cataloged nitrogen, oxygen, and argon of the library in town.  He knew it was black poetry, written by black people, for black people.  Prose gazing upon him—he chooses pride, staring straight into the paint’s eyes.  He chooses superiority.  Affirms his blackness.  All the culture negated can now be accepted.  Again, the night fell, exposing himself to himself in the mirror of the void.  Strength peaked, tomorrow, he would venture back into town and share his dream.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next dawn, with a new sun and rejuvenating experience, Fanon leaves the comforting shelter of négritude and makes his way down the exposed tundra back for town.  The slight chill on his back signals both a drop in altitude; and a man with a lazy-eye, black spectacles, and black book in hand sitting near a stone.  It was Sartre, who immediately stares into Fanon’s eyes with a fourth, penetrating gaze that freezes him in his tracks.  The gaze sounds the depths of the unified mind-body schema.  He scowls back and attempts to carry on, but Sartre blocks his path.  Standing there, he opens the book which has the word ‘Orpheus,’ inscribed on it, and says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to the massif you return from, and oh what a beautiful rock it is.  What colors and rhythms and prose!  You will go back into town, and tell them of the fracture the canyon carves, and indeed, they will see you.  They may even see you differently.  But alas!  Remember, that your antithesis will be quartered and drawn for the fulfillment of the necessary Promethean Synthesis!  After tirelessly separating each limb from your corpus, they will drag your entrails along the cobblestone road out of town for everyone to see your destruction fade into the horizon, and they will see—your solubility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanon gapes ahead as Sartre carries on,
  I remember when I was naive like you.  One day, you will come to understand as I did, my boy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanon stands up, and on two solid feet, shouts back at him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“White man!  In the midst of battle, the soldier cannot contemplate the war!”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just moments before, he had been unbridled and celestially impulsive.  Now, he could
feel the weight mounting on his feet.  The white Frenchman stares unflinchingly into Fanon’s fractured unity.  Still on his feet, he continues forward, down into the swampy town shouting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck you, Sartre!  I needed not to know!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just outside town, a drunken vagrant in an old shivering wheelchair, bitterly calls out to catch the fast-paced Fanon’s ear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heyh!  Doan chu know?  Their gonna to do to yew what they di’ tah meh!  ‘We are both casualties”’ (119).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanon evades the derelict eyes and hurries his pace.  His inner orb focusing on the astral-terra synesthesia, he stops, tilts his eyes closed to the sky, and shouts from his knees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will turn over each element of the cosmos before I concede!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1. “We are what we are not, and we are not what we are.”&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2. “The existentialists say at once that man is anguish.  What that means is this: the man who involves himself and realizes that he is not only the person he chooses to be, but also a lawmaker who is, at the same time, choosing all mankind as well as himself, cannot help escape the feeling of his total and deep responsibility” (Marino 347, excerpt from Existentialism is a Humanism).  Definite echoes of Kant’s 1st form categorical imperative.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3. He doesn’t lack &lt;em&gt;bewusstsein&lt;/em&gt; in the Marxian sense. Rather, he runs away from it because he is afraid, and thus has chosen to be a coward.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4. Fear and Trembling (1843) Søren Kierkegaard, widely seen as father of existentialism.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5. “...slave morality from the outset says No to what is “outside,” what is “different,” what is “not itself”...this need to direct one’s view outward instead of back to oneself—is the essence of ressentiment…” (Ch. 10 On the Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6. The white gaze violates Kant’s 2nd form categorical imperative.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;7. “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;8. I woke this morning with my mind&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Set on Freedom.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah!  -One of the gospel hymns that rang out as marchers on Washington poured out of their trains and buses in 1963, to see Dr. King Jr. tell the people, about his dream. (Hansen The Dream 34)

Apparently, nobody wanted to broach the subject of millions of Jews being exterminated—but he did.  He felt obligated to explain to the population how and why anti-Semitism exists.  As a Jew myself, his words had an enormous impact on me, as he explained to me why my people have historically been scapegoated and discriminated.  He does this by breaking down the type of person who would choose to live with such extreme hatred.  His breakdown is outlined in my essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This breakdown shook the medical student Frantz Fanon to his core.  For the first time in his life, someone was sensibly explaining to him the nature of hatred and the type of person who harbors it.  However, while Fanon was captivated, he felt slightly unsatisfied.  Why?  Because Jews are essentially white people, so they are difficult to distinguish.  Black people like Fanon, on the other hand, could never blend into the white crowd. Therefore, the relentless hatred thrown his way was constant and debilitating.  That is why he wrote his book, Black Skins, White Masks in 1952.  It focuses on how black people live the experience of overwhelming racism, simply because their skin sets them starkly apart from the ruling white race.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this essay for people who study philosophy and history; however, I believe there is something to be gained by all readers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="philosophy"></category></entry></feed>
