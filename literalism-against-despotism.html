<p class=indented>In 1812, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte singularly and needlessly waged war on Russia.  He amassed an army of over 600,000 soldiers and pushed forth toward the river Neman.  Once he crossed that Rubicon, he had again, singularly, committed himself and the lives of the French people to an unfathomably horrendous bloodbath.  After hypothermia, starvation, disease and enemy slaughter ravaged the <i>Grand Armée</i>, less than 200,000 soldiers lived to return to France.  The stragglers were so ravished that after gorging themselves with food for the first time in months, another nearly 100,000 soldiers died from their debilitated bodies’ inability to digest the food.  All said, less than 100,000 soldiers lived the tell the gruesome tale, all because one despot had complete and tyrannical control over his nation.

<p class=indented>
Of course in 1812 the United States had just recently become an independent nation; however, similar stories of the downfall of tyranny had made an impression on the Framers’ mind, causing them to create an Executive with undoubtedly limited powers.  Indeed, Article II of the constitution is relatively minuscule when compared to article I.  The message was clear: despots lead to despotism—tyrants lead to tyranny.  We must also remember that the U.S. had fought for its independence against a monarchy, a monarchy which was seen as having suffocated the liberty out of the colonists.  All this in mind, the scope of Executive branch power becomes crucial in our constitutional discourse.
</p>

<p class=indented>
Perhaps the most important supreme court case to address this discussion was <i>Youngstown Sheet & Tube CO. v. Sawyer</i> (1952).  In it, differing theories on the scope of Executive power was articulated, and these theories have served as the framework within which constitutional law has operated ever since.  Here, I will be outlining the different theories, and how they have been applied to four other important supreme court cases.  Ultimately, I argue that we must abide by Justice Black’s literalist jurisprudence to protect our liberties and stave off Executive tyranny.  The only flexibility we should permit in this literalism is when that flexibility is designed to limit the Executive even further, as the prospect of an overpowering Executive threatens to curtail our liberties at any moment.  Such is the nature of a leader: to seek out such power, and such is the nature of the social corpus: to give it over to him.

In 1952, the Korean War was at full steam.  Labor disputes threatened the production of our nation’s steel which was a perceived threat to national security that President Truman could not accept.  As a result, Truman issued an Executive order, seizing control of steel production.  He argued that the stoppage of the steel production would immediately and seriously threaten national security, as steel was a crucial resource needed to fight the war in Korea.  In Youngstown Sheet & Tube CO. v. Sawyer, the courts decided whether or not such an Executive action was constitutional.  Delivering the opinion of the court, Justice Black held that this act by the Executive was unconstitutional because  Presidential power must derive from either a Congressional statute or an expressed constitutional authority within article II.  Since, Black argued, Congress had given the President no such authority, “[i]t [was] clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did, it must be found in some provisions of the constitution” (324).  Black held that no such provision existed, as the provision granting the President Commander in Chief of the armed forces did not grant him the power to “...take possession of private property to keep labor disputes from stopping production” (324).  He argued that such an act is tantamount to lawmaking, and lawmaking is expressly the job of the legislature, not the Executive, who carries those laws out.  As such, Truman’s order was deemed unconstitutional and struck down.  This line of reasoning has come to define the ‘literalist approach,’ which only allows Executive powers which are expressly enumerated in the constitution.
</p>

<p class=indented>
Justice Jackson offered a concurring opinion, but his line of reasoning provided more breathing room for Presidential power in future instances.  Jackson outlined a three-part ‘workable government approach.’  First, he states that the President's “authority is at its maximum” when he “acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress” (325).  Truman’s Executive order did not fall within this first category, because there was no Congressional statute giving Truman such authority.  Second, if the President acts neither pursuant to nor in violation of a Congressional statute, there is a bit of a grey area, or “zone of twilight” in which the President should only act if there is an imperative to do so.  Truman’s actions did not fall under this category either, because Congress had not been silent on the matter; rather, they had passed three different statutes addressing the labor issue at hand.  Lastly, the President's power “is at its lowest ebb” when “the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress…” (325)  Here, according to Jackson, is where Truman’s Executive order lay, and as such, Jackson concurred that this Executive order was unconstitutional.  However, as we can see, Jackson’s three categories give an Executive far more flexibility in taking action as compared to Black’s literalist approach.
</p>

<p class=indented>
Justice Douglas also concurred with the opinion of the court, warning us that, “[a] Executive power—from the reign of ancient kings to the rule of modern dictators—has the outward appearance of efficiency” (326).  However, Douglass introduced a third way of approaching this question of Executive scope.  He argued that when an Executive has been granted certain powers outside of the constitution for a significant period of time, these powers, “may be treated as gloss on ‘Executive power’...” (329)  This can be seen as another form of workable government approach, which acknowledges that some traditions of Executive power become ingrained in our way of governing, and such traditions should be added onto the spirit of the constitution.
</p>

<p class=indented>
Lastly, Chief Justice Vinson leads the dissent, arguing that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, and “these [were] extraordinary times” (329).  Vinson claims that as the nation’s Commander in Chief, Truman had the authority to seize the mills because action was required to protect our country.  Military operations can take strange forms in extraordinary times, and in 1952, it took the form of taking control of the steel mills.  Simply put, stoppage of the steel mills put the country in a position of insecurity, and it is the job of the Commander in Chief to ensure the security of the nation.  As far as Executive reach is concerned, Vinson’s position represents the most flexible in terms of granting Executive powers.  His position essentially allows the President to do whatever he feels necessary to ensure our security.  As I argue, this affords the Executive far too much authority, because it is in the nature of the Executive to amass power, and of the populace to want to cede power to the Executive to feel more secure.  This nature is of course short sighted, as it ends up creating a despot who threatens our liberty.
</p>

<p class=indented>
Now we examine the line-item-veto, and the court case which addresses its constitutionality: <i>Clinton v. City of New York</i> (1998).  The City of New York argued that the President does not have the authority to strike down only parts of a bill, but rather, he could either veto the whole thing or not veto it at all.  Justice Stevens speaking on behalf of the majority agreed, employing an approach akin to Justice Black’s literalism.  He says, “there is no provision in the constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes” (338).  Literally following the letter of the constitution, President Clinton had no authority to strike down only a component of a bill.  Justice Kennedy reinforces the decision of the majority by reminding us how important separation of powers is in protecting our liberties.  He points out that “[t]he Constitution's structure requires a stability which transcends the convenience of the moment” (339).  He asks us to envision a world in which we capriciously changed the content of the constitution to suit us however we think best at the moment.  Such instability would be counterproductive, and most importantly, It would jeopardize our most sacred values, such as liberty.  Justice Breyer leads the dissent by making an interesting argument appealing to prudence.  The dissent points out that at the time of our Framers, the scope of each bill passed by Congress was minuscule in comparison to modern times.  Therefore, the Presidents of the past could easily veto a bill summarily knowing that they disagreed with the entirety of the bill.  Contemporarily bills, on the other hand, contain hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages of meticulous details.  Therefore, it only makes sense that the President can choose to rid a bill of certain particulars while simultaneously choosing to keep the rest of it.  It is not prudent to throw away an entire bill simply because the President disagrees with a few minor details, as was the case here with Clinton.  Furthermore, the dissent argues that the courts ought not “referee a dispute among the other two branches” (340).  The dissent's position is much more akin to Jackson’s three-part workable government approach.  Specifically, this would fit into Jackson’s first category, as here the President was acting in line with a Congressional statute, namely the Line Item Veto Act.  Jackson would argue that since Congress delegated this power to the President, the President was well within his authority to act pursuant to the wishes of Congress.  However, Jackson’s workable government approach is far too flexible, because what if the party of the Executive happens to control both the House and the Senate?  Given Jackson’s reasoning, this would enable Congress to essentially give the President a blank check via statute.  Such latitude provides little safeguard against despotism—a safeguard crucial in combating the populace’s tendency to give their liberty over to a President hungry for power in exchange for security (in a Hobbesian quid pro quo).

Next, we discuss the power of appointments.  In <i>Morrison v. Olson</i> (1988), Chief Justice Rehnquist speaking on behalf of the majority held that Congressional appointment of an independent counsel to investigate certain members of the Executive branch was constitutional.  He bases this opinion in the appointments clause of Article II which states that “Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments” (Article II, § 2, Cl. 2).  Here, Congress argues that they have vested appointment power of an inferior officer (the independent counsel) in the courts, which has dispatched this independent counsel within the Executive.  The key distinction here is whether or not the appointment in question is an ‘inferior’ position or a ‘principal’ position.  If the latter, only the President would have the authority to appoint such a position.  Justice Rehnquist found that the special counsel falls under the distinction of an inferior officer, and thus, Congress has the authority to vest appointment power with the courts.  He reasons that this is because 1) the council is “subject to removal by a higher Executive Branch official” (358).  2)  The council has a limited function.  3) The council's jurisdiction is limited, And 4) the counsel’s tenure is limited as well.  All of these details render the independent counsel an inferior office in the eyes of the majority, and thus, Congress has authority to vest in the courts this appointment power.  Such a position would have to be classified under Black’s literalist approach, as it takes the appointments clause literally to the word, thus not granting the President any extra power.  In his fervent dissent, Justice Scalia vehemently claims that the decision violates the separation of powers principle.  Scalia argues that Congress has ostensibly vested an Executive power in the courts, which violates article II, which states that “the Executive power shall be vested in the President of the united states”  (Article II, § 1, Cl. 1).  In other words, the independent counsel holds Executive power, but all Executive power is vested in the President, and the President did not appoint the independent counsel.  Thus violating article, I § 1, Cl. 1.  This is because “[g]overnmental investigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially Executive function” (359).  In short, Scalia finds this to be a dangerously slippery slope ending in blurred lines between the three government spheres.  Fitting Scalia’s position into any one larger theory is difficult.  It could be argued that it fits Black's literalism because he is claiming to interpret the constitution literally.  It could also be argued that Scalia is echoing Jackson’s third category, arguing that even when the President is always empowered to exercise his enumerated powers even when acting counter to a Congressional statute.  Ultimately, this is where there should be a little breathing room in within literalism.  Both sides argue that they are reading the constitution literally, although, Scalia’s argument seems to be more technically literal.  However, oversight of the potentially tyrannical Executive is a must, for, this is the branch most susceptible to despotism. Therefore, Justice Rehnquist's quasi-literalist reading is rightfully adopted here, because it is a literalism that is flexible enough to hold the Executive accountable.  Such a paradigm does not fit squarely into Black, Jackson, or Douglas’ theories, as it seeks only limited flexibility <i>when that flexibility is intended to thwart tyranny within the Executive</i>.  Which is a dangerous prospect, as the populace is so eager to give over their liberties in exchange for security, and when security itself is so easily made to be fleeting by a power-thirsty executive.

The question of Executive scope extends to formal recognition of foreign sovereignties as well.  Such was the case in <i>Zivotofsky v. Kerry</i> (2015).  Congress had passed a statute allowing U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to list ‘Israel’ as their birthplace on their passports.  The Secretary of State refused to comply with this statute, arguing that such a Congressional mandate amounted to Congress forcing the President to recognize Israel as a foreign sovereignty, and only the President alone could declare such a recognition.  Speaking for the majority, Justice Kennedy argued that such a statute was unconstitutional because it robbed the Executive of an exclusive function.  Kennedy acknowledges that here, the President was within Jackson’s 3rd category, giving him the least amount of latitude to act.  Nonetheless, since the constitution gives the Executive exclusive and conclusive power to recognize foreign states, reasoned Kennedy, Congress had no authority to demand that the Executive recognize Israel as a state.  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito disagree that the language of Article II gives the Executive exclusive and conclusive recognition power.  They argue in their dissent that such language amounts to Executive duties, not powers.  Therefore, the President has a duty to receiving ambassadors, for example, but this in no way implies a power of state recognition.  Moreover, they argue, simply stating a birthplace as Jerusalem on a passport is not tantamount to formal recognition of a country.  Identification does not equate to recognition.  In another dissent, Justice Scalia echoes these sentiments, saying “[i]t is utterly impossible for this deference to private requests to constitute an act that unequivocally manifests an intention to grant recognition” (393).  Furthermore, Scalia points out that Congress has the authority to ‘establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization” (Article I, § 8 Cl. 4).  He argues that regulating passports falls under this authority. Therefore the Executive must honor the actions of Congress as backed by the constitution.  The holding given by justice Kennedy represents what I would consider to be a Douglas-type Executive power gloss.  Since the President had been in charge of recognizing foreign states for so long, this power becomes glossed into the Executive's authority.  Such a holding violates Justice Black's literalism because there is more evidence within the constitution for Congress to regulate passports than for the President to have exclusive recognition power.  As Kennedy himself acknowledges, this issue falls within Justice Jackson’s 3rd category of low Presidential latitude; however, Kennedy seems to be generous towards the President, citing ambiguous evidence supporting the President’s exclusive and conclusive power.  If we fit a more literalist approach here, as I suggest we do, this decision would have been held in favor of Congress, thus forcing the Executive to honor Zivotofsky’s passport request.  Such literalism is the most effective tool for keeping the Executive in check.  This issue here on its own may be somewhat inconsequential in terms of Executive tyranny, but to give the Executive any more powers than absolutely necessary is a dangerous prospect.
</p>

<p class=indented>
We conclude with perhaps the most glaring example of potential Executive overreach: <i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i> (2004).  Petitioner and U.S. citizen Hamdi was challenging not only his classification as an ‘enemy combatant,’ but more importantly, the Executive’s authority to detain him indefinitely without due process as a result of this classification.  Justice O’Connor speaking for the majority held that the Executive was not authorized to perform such a detainment.  She reminds us that “history and common sense teach us that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential to become a means for oppression …” (407).  In her decision, she carefully weighs the values of due process and liberty against the importance of national security.  Ultimately, she makes concessions to the Executive, allowing them to admit a lower bar of evidence against Hamdi in federal courts, but she holds that Hamdi must be afforded all the due process that is rightfully his as an American citizen.  Justices Souter and Ginsberg, in part concurring and in part dissenting go a step further, arguing that Hamdi should be released pursuant to the Non-Detention Act, given the dearth of evidence against him.  They saliently remind us that “[t]he defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each” (409-410).  Justice Scalia offers a somewhat simple dissent, arguing that Hamdi should be tried for treason which carries its own constitutional proceedings.  Lastly, Justice Thomas in his dissent argues that the courts should stay out of this issue entirely, and furthermore, the Executive is acting “well within its authority” because he was acting pursuant to the Congressional statute, AUMF.  Thomas’ argument lines up squarely with Jackson’s first principle, giving the Executive the greatest latitude because it was acting pursuant to a Congressional statute.  However, this argument affords the President far too much authority and completely ignores the warnings articulated by both Justice O’Connor and Souter.  They rightfully remind us how delicate the principle of liberty is, and how easily an Executive can monopolize that liberty under the guise of protection.  Justice Scalia offers what he considers to be a literalist approach, which is a more efficacious plan than Justice Thomas’ given that his approach still demands constitutional backing.  Interestingly, Justice Souter’s argument can be classified under Jackson's third category, as he sites congressional statute opposing the detainment.  Ultimately, the majority makes an important literalist decision that serves to bolster our bill of rights and protect liberty against despotic tyranny.
</p>

<p class=indented>
We have examined five different ways in which the Executive can potentially and dangerously increase his power.  Let us never forget the dangers of a despot, and always fight to protect our liberties against the threat of dictatorship.  Yes, national security is essential, but liberty-security is even more essential, as it allows us to maintain a stable state that is prepared and fortified against outside threats.  In a rare twist of events, our constitution is well-suited for such a task.  Therefore, we must adjudicate our common law system literally, only stretching that literalism <i>when the stretching serves to further protect us against the Executive</i>.
