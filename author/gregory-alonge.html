<p class=indented>In 1812, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte singularly and needlessly waged war on Russia.  He amassed an army of over 600,000 soldiers and pushed forth toward the river Neman.  Once he crossed that Rubicon, he had again, singularly, committed himself and the lives of the French people to an unfathomably horrendous bloodbath.  After hypothermia, starvation, disease and enemy slaughter ravaged the <i>Grand Armée</i>, less than 200,000 soldiers lived to return to France.  The stragglers were so ravished that after gorging themselves with food for the first time in months, another nearly 100,000 soldiers died from their …</p>

<p class=indented>In 1954, Theodor Adorno invited us to watch television with him.  While tempting, I instead opted to go to the museum with Walter Benjamin.  This past weekend, I embarked upon a pilgrimage to the J. Paul Getty Museum in West Los Angeles.  For this project, I will create a phenomenological account of that pilgrimage, as informed and illuminated by Walter Benjamin’s 1935 essay, <i>The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility</i>.  To do this, I will first discuss my visit to the iconic paintings in the upper level of the West Pavilion.  I …</p>

<p class=indented>Without a good seed, soil, water, and sunlight, a rose will never bloom.  The same is true of a free-spirited woman.  In order for her to truly prosper, she needs an environment of liberty for her inner seed to grow into a flower of freedom.  Yet up until the 1960’s, very few if any American women were actually given this encouraging environment, leading to generation after generation of oppressed persons—good seeds that were never given soil, water or sunlight.  But that began to change in the 1960’s when finally, American culture began to properly …</p>

<p>Long before Plato, indeed, long before even the pre-Socratics, Hesiod’s Theogony declared Eros as one of the four principal deities responsible for shaping our universe.  He considered it to be the fairest of the deities, responsible for our sexual desire and urge to reproduce[1].  By the time Plato takes on the topic it has changed slightly, but what's clear, is that Eros was a pervasive concept that garnered thought and reverence from the greatest of thinkers.  Plato, through Socrates, discusses Eros in his dialogue, <em>Phaedrus</em>.  A dynamic dialogue, <em>Phaedrus</em> focuses on philosophical communication by using Eros as the …</p>

<p>As the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre sees it, life centers around the choices we are free to make, and the situation from which we make those choices.  A Sartrean situation is the amalgamation of uncontrollable circumstances a person finds herself in, like her age, height, and yes, race.  According to the French philosopher and playwright, a human being is her situation, combined with …</p>

Why did Jean-Paul Sartre choose to write <em>Anti-Semite</em> and <em>Jew</em> in 1945?  Because he was pissed off.  He was angry at his native France for ignoring the problem.  At the conclusion of WWII, France was focusing on the positive, while trying to rebuild Europe.  Apparently, nobody wanted to broach the subject of millions of Jews being exterminated—but he did.  He felt obligated to explain to the population how and why anti-Semitism exists.  As a Jew myself, his words had an enormous impact on me, as he explained to me why my people have historically been scapegoated and discriminated.  He …</p>
