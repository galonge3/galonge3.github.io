<p class=indented>Without a good seed, soil, water, and sunlight, a rose will never bloom.  The same is true of a free-spirited woman.  In order for her to truly prosper, she needs an environment of liberty for her inner seed to grow into a flower of freedom.  Yet up until the 1960’s, very few if any American women were actually given this encouraging environment, leading to generation after generation of oppressed persons—good seeds that were never given soil, water or sunlight.  But that began to change in the 1960’s when finally, American culture began to properly nurture the independence of women.  One such woman, was and is Marlene Baddin.  She, was a seed of innate drive, that was planted by her parents in the soil of the zeitgeist; which then received water in the form of subversive television, and sunlight in the form of West Los Angeles feminism.  Her rose was just one of many in a vast bloom of an entire generation.  The result was the first American generation in US history of truly liberated women, who fought against the gross excesses of capitalism and consumerism that created oppressive gender roles.</p>

<p class=indented>Marlene Baddin was born in Fresno California, 1951.  She grew up in a Jewish middle-class family of four with her parents and little brother.  Her parents, who no doubt embodied the contemporary popular mind, had the greatest influence on Marlene of anybody.  She had a loving relationship with both of them; but tragically, her father passed away when she was only seventeen, devastating the family.  Her father was an academic and respected professional symphony musician across the bay area.  Marlene remembers him lovingly, emphasizing that he was an enlightened artist with a great sense of humor.  Her mom was the wife of an academic who rotated with the other wives to host elaborate social functions.  She was everything Marlene and her brother could want in a mom—a fun, warm, and intelligent women even to this day.  Marlene remarks that both her parents were easy going people of a liberal mindset.  However, while her mother wanted to go to college and finish her degree, her “father was…you know, of that era where women stayed home and did not work.  My mother wanted to go back to school, but he didn’t let her” (Baddin).  In the 1950’s, the man’s need to be the one and only breadwinner was still overwhelmingly strong because of strict suburban middle-class gender roles.  Marlene’s father was adhering to pre-established gender roles—not out of malice, but out of social influence.  He wanted to live a traditional life, with his traditional wife.  Why?  Because he believed that is what brought happiness.  But according to leading philosopher of this time Herbert Marcuse, while heavily gendered consumer culture grew within middle-class families, happiness did not (xviii).  Marlene’s father sensed this, and did not want the same oppressive gender roles for his daughter.  She explains, “It was interesting.  Even though he wouldn’t let my mother go to college, there was no question about [me getting] my education” (Baddin).  Deep down he sensed what Marcuse articulated—that the traditional gendered society hinders happiness.</p>

<p class=indented>In addition to Marcuse, Simone De Beauvoir’s influence on the mid-20th century zeitgeist is unquestioned.  Her effect on American culture in is just one example of a philosopher helping to shift the popular mindset.  Other such impactful people include Karl Marx, Allen Ginsberg, the aforementioned Herbert Marcuse, and Cesar Chavez.  We know these thinkers affected Marlene growing up when she says, “I was really into poetry, and I was really into the philosophers of the time” (Baddin).  De Beauvoir and the other great thinkers’ influence began to awaken people across the globe to how a woman can actually be liberated, including Marlene’s parents and Marlene herself.  According to Ann Curthoys, the most influential aspect of De Beauvoir, more so than her words, was her real-life experiences as detailed through her autobiographies.  Curthoys makes it clear that what made De Beauvoir resonate, was that she walked the walk of an independent woman.  She details for us how De Beauvoir used to leave her house early on Thursday and Sunday mornings winter or summer, and often return home late at night (7).   Chronicled in her autobiography “The Prime of Life,” De Beauvoir writes, “I didn’t bother with all the preliminaries…I would slip on an old dress and a pair of espadrilles, and take a few bananas and buns with me in a basket” (77).  She went out on walks regularly regardless of weather—weather was not stopping her.  She came home when she wanted—time was not constraining her.  She wore a comfortable dress—clothes would not restrict her (unlike her Victorian predecessors).  Furthermore, De Beauvoir was expected to marry, have kids, and rear those kids. That she was doing none of these things illustrates just how subversive she was—and was happy to be.  Marlene’s parents absorbed this model for women to be free and happy, and they wanted it for Marlene.  That, is why her dad wanted her to go to college even though he did not want his wife to.  He knew that Marlene would be happier given the freedom De Beauvoir had.</p>

<p class=indented>In the 1960’s, even the television of Marlene’s teenage years became a pointed attack on traditional suburban, middle-class values.  In order to understand 1960’s TV, one must first understand the suburbanization of America in the 1950’s.   In Laura Morowitz’ article, she details the mass migration of middle-class families into the suburbs.  In this era, more than half of the sitcoms released were “Leave It to Beaver” style shows—depictions of a suburban family, going through suburban daily life.  Then, “A medium first marketed as family entertainment, aimed at selling consumer products to growing families...” (36) The medium did this because the economic opportunity was there, and in a capitalist system, every economic opportunity must be exploited<sup>1</sup>.  In summary, the families moved into the suburbs, and started watching TV shows about families in the suburbs.  This left the door open for advertisers to sell their suburban products to the families, which created an environment where “it seemed that television, suburbia, consumerism and the domestic sitcom were all inherently intertwined” (36).  This suburban family consumer culture was gender oppressive, meaning both men and women were restricted by gender molds that came out of the suburban structure.  Specifically, men had to be breadwinners, who woke up early, shaved their face, read the morning newspaper and then went off to work for a boss at a menial desk job.  The woman was expected to marry one of these poor saps, and be his domestic goddess—she who keeps everything clean, calm, cool and collected—all while wearing high heels and a nice dress.  These suffocating gender boxes led to mass oppression<sup>2</sup>.  Counter culture, and the subsequent Women’s Liberation Movement, ‘hippie’ scene, sexual revolution and other cultural movements, were the direct result of this oppression; according to both leading thinkers of that time like Marcuse and De Beauvoir, and leading academics of modern times, like James Suri and Laura Morowitz (Celarant 42, Marcuse 91, Morowitz 36, Suri 49).  As Morowitz points out, TV shows like, “The Munsters” and “The Adams Family,” replaced the 1950s “Leave it To Beaver” shows, and took direct shots at the idealized suburban American family architype (35, 49).  These new shows of the 60’s depicted families that did not fit into the oppressive gender boxes; yet, they still managed to be lovable and relatable.  When Marlene and other impressionable teenage girls saw these subversive shows, for the first time in American history, they were being sent the message: IT IS OKAY TO BE DIFFERENT.</p>

<p class=indented>At the age of eighteen after graduating high school, Marlene was ready to leave her small town of Fresno, and go to college, so she left for Los Angeles with a clear sense of identity and purpose.  Upon arrival in West Los Angeles, she was pleasantly surprised to see that her new environment was a safe haven for free-spirits like herself.  We know West LA was such a place because a local school, University High School, was undergoing its own major feminism movement called, “The Red Tide.”  This was a local, primarily student driven movement, but faculty and community members no doubt played a major supporting role.  Matthew Ides details that, “Red Tide members were agents of enlistment, and Uni High and West Los Angeles served as the recruitment site”(298).  This is not to suggest that Uni High students were recruiting women across the globe like college football coaches.  Rather, it shows that the cultural shift towards women’s liberation was widespread.  West Los Angeles via the Red Tide, was a place where women of all ages took a stand for what they believed in, and talked about issues that concerned them, like abortion rights and equal pay.  For the first time, Teenage girls and women across the country were not summarily shunned for talking about previously taboo topics.  For Marlene, moving to a place like West Los Angeles, where the Red Tide movement was a symbol of women fighting for liberation, allowed her to further cultivate her own free will.  In other words, West Los Angeles provided the much-needed sunlight that gave Marlene’s flower of freedom a true chance to grow.</p>

<p class=indented>Separate from her environment, Marlene reports having an innate personality that is independent and adventurous.  She values travel, education, creativity and entrepreneurship—in a word: liberation.  She explains, “I was never a joiner.  I never liked being in a group kind of thing, it was never ideal” (Baddin).  It is not that she was aloof; but rather, she was a free-spirit, who never enjoyed regimented mandates, or structured paths.  Marlene’s major life decisions exemplify both her personality, and her generation’s newly encouraged mindset.  In the mid-seventies, a few years after marrying her first husband ‘Rich,’ the two of them decided that Rich would open up his own seafood market, while Marlene would help bankroll the endeavor.  Fortunately, the seafood market was a success.  Unfortunately, when Marlene expressed her desire to open up her own branch of the business, Rich “…wasn’t having any part of it.  He wanted me to be Mrs. ‘fresh fish and seafood market,’ and go to mommy and me’s, and blah blah blah, and I was like…Huh?” (Baddin) Why was Rich not supportive?  Because he wanted his family to fit the pre-1960’s American architype.  He believed that if Marlene opened her own business, his ideal family would be lost.  It was the same dynamic as her father not wanting her mother to get her degree, only this time, the woman in the dynamic did not comply.  Marlene left Rich, and she cites this as the large straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back: “A great deal of the reason that ‘Rich’ and I weren’t able to stay together was because I think I was growing in a more liberated way as a woman, and I felt that he was holding me back” (Baddin).  Her wings would not be clipped, and she was going to make sure of it.  Marlene, and the women of her generation were making self-affirming life decisions, making them the first generation of American women to fight back en masse against the suffocating molds of archaic femininity.</p>

<p class=indented>The evidence for Marlene’s innate grit and independence continues.  By the time Marlene was 30, she was a single woman (by her own choosing) with a 3-year-old son.  These single mothers were, and still are stigmatized with various prejudices, a leading one being that all single women struggle to survive financially and raise a child adequately.  This preconceived notion of a single mom’s frailty certainly did not apply to Marlene, and one study suggests that middle-class single mothers persevere as a group more often than not.  The study found that “Single mothers are generally resilient…identify themselves as strong and able to achieve goals…reported that they try their best…[and]said that they were proud of achievements and believe past successes give them the ability to be successful in the future” (Kjellstrand, Harper 323).  Overall, single mothers in this study were strong, capable and confident women.  They certainly were not the pitiful image of an overwhelmed mother.  Rather, they were in control, and in a loving and ambitious way.  The same was true of Marlene.  She confided in me that she was indeed her son’s breadwinner, and she always provided food, insurance and all the basic comforts in life for the two of them.  She also told me that she always had a close, trusting relationship with her son (Baddin).  Marlene, not unlike the majority of middle-class single mothers, was beyond capable, and the American public was starting to see it with their own eyes for the first time in the second half of the 20th century.</p>

<p class=indented>The 1960’s and onward proved to be the first era in this country’s history that enabled free-spirited women like Marlene Baddin to be given legitimate encouragement to live liberated.  This came about through a shift in the environment caused, by the excesses of consumerism, that resulted in a change in popular mind and culture.  However, this is not to imply that we live in an egalitarian society in which men and women are treated equally, and there are no gender roles at all.  We have a long way toward equality, but America took the true first steps in the 1960’s, when the American people collectively shifted their attitudes on what it meant to be a truly free person—woman or man.</p>

Beyond gender roles, all behavior was strictly monitored and controlled.
