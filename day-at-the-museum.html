<p class=indented>In 1954, Theodor Adorno invited us to watch television with him.  While tempting, I instead opted to go to the museum with Walter Benjamin.  This past weekend, I embarked upon a pilgrimage to the J. Paul Getty Museum in West Los Angeles.  For this project, I will create a phenomenological account of that pilgrimage, as informed and illuminated by Walter Benjamin’s 1935 essay, <i>The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility</i>.  To do this, I will first discuss my visit to the iconic paintings in the upper level of the West Pavilion.  I will then discuss my subsequent visit to the Center for Photographs downstairs in that same pavilion.  Lastly, I will take the reader down to the gift shop with me on my way out.  My account will focus on two major pieces of art: Vincent Van Gogh’s, Irises (1889), and Oscar Rejlander’s allegorical photograph montage, <i>The Two Ways of Life</i> (1857).  By examining my interaction with these works of art and others, I will analyze Benjamin’s thesis: that the auratic nature of famous historical paintings render their effect politically impotent, while on the contrary, the effect of photography is indeed politically subversive because of its ability to display the real world as something to be molded.</p>

<p class=indented>Last friday, I drove to the one place where unique items can always be found: the museum.  Of course, the neoclassical shrine of unique art was symbolically and literally placed at an elevation, so I embarked upon a tram ride that would slowly close the distance between the world of fungibility and the world of the originality.  Indeed, the trip felt like an ascent to the heavens, as majestically verdant views unraveled themselves from the tram windows before my eyes.  While, “[a] painting has always exerted a claim to be viewed primarily by a single person or by a few,” that was certainly not the case here (36).  Indeed, I was just one of dozens on this tram, and the tram itself was only one of hundreds for the day.</p>

<p class=indented>This, according to Benjamin, is because, “[t]he simultaneous viewing of paintings by a large audience, as happens in the 19th century, is an early symptom of the crisis in painting, a crisis triggered...by the artwork’s claim to the attention of masses” (36).  For Benjamin, at some point in the 19th century, artwork under the auspices of capitalism and its technologically reproductive fruits began to shift from cult-value to exhibition-value.  That is to say, art in its oldest and most primitive form served as a portal or intermediary between humans and the spiritual world (25).  This is not art for human perception, it’s art for spiritual connection.  But, as history unfolded and capitalism laid claim to the dominant mode of production, this ritual value increasingly gave way to exhibition value.  Then, <i>“[w]ith the emancipation of specific artistic practices from the service of ritual, the opportunities for exhibiting their products increase[d]”</i> (25).  As a result, institutions like the Getty not only allow for large viewing audiences, they indeed facilitate it.  Thus, myself and thousands of others that day were on our way to see art for the sake of seeing art (25)<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p class=indented>Tram at the top, I stepped off like a proverbial kid in a candy shop: so much to do, and so much to see.  Naturally, nothing was to be experienced before a leisurely bite in the bucolic manicured gardens of neatly arranged flowers and foliage.  The air seemed fresher—the food tasted sweeter.  Indeed, that was the best damn oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had in my life.  It was almost as if something was pervading the geist, an aura of some sort.  It must have been coming from somewhere, the inclination in such moments is to find out from where.</p>

<p class=indented>Now, the Getty has an abundance of exhibits, but for some reason, call it happenstance, call it auratic pull, I decided to enter the West Pavilion and head upstairs—I knew there were paintings up there, and I wanted paintings.  I walked through the threshold, tennis shoes squeaking with every step, turned to my right, and saw a painting mounted on the wall of ships on a marina at dawn.  My philistine sensibilities being what they are, I asked myself, “hey, isn’t that, like, a <i>really</i> famous painting?”  I read the description, and lo, it was Claude Monet’s, <i>Impression, Sunrise</i> (1872).  Yep, famous indeed.  I immediately felt a rush—I was penetrating the source of the aura that made my cookie sweeter.  I continued onward.</p>

<p class=indented>Passing similar recognizable paintings, I came across an entryway to a small room with light charcoal paint, polished hardwood floors, and dozens of people bustling inside.  I was confused.  Why were so many people concentrated in this room?  There was a tour group and several people clustered in the back right corner taking pictures.  I looked at a few paintings of fruit bowls before coming across an eye-catcher:  Édouard Manet’s, <i>Rue Mosnier with Flags</i>.  I loved it.  It was luminously intricate.  Both the bleached cobble-stoned road and the swinging tri-color flags seemed to be lit up by an unseen sun placed above the frame.  My attention was next grabbed by Monet’s, <i>The Portrait of Rouen Cathedral in Morning Light</i>.  The more I looked at it, the more I could distinguish the ornate features of a gothic church through the dark morning fog, a gradual unveiling that compelled me to keep searching.  As I continued, my excitement mounted.</p>

<p class=indented>Finally, I made my way to the back right corner where everyone was crowded around a painting of what looked to be blue flowers with green leaves.  The awe-struck huddle was standing at a distance, which only made me want to get closer.  “[T]he urge [grew] stronger  to get a hold of [the] object at close range…” (23)  Now in between the crowd and the painting itself, I looked up and read, ‘Vincent Van Gogh, <i>Irises</i>, (1889).’  A chill ran up my spine.  A Van Gogh!  Even I knew this was a big deal indeed.  Here it was, this room, this painting, the source of the ambiance that permeated the air of the garden and marble walkways.  It all made sense now, everyone was fixated on that piece as if stuck in time.  One particularly statuesque woman of middle-age stood there cemented in place with headphones around ears and pamphlet in hand—she wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon.  She wasn’t even looking directly at the painting. Instead, she was standing sideways to it, eyes glazed in a sort of liminal state between the floor, pamphlet, and room at large.  This woman, the other onlookers, the paintings themselves, and the sequestered nature of the place, all drove home the unique feel of this gallery, and indeed, entire museum.  But what was it that I was feeling?  According to Benjamin, I was feeling <i>aura</i>.</p>

<p class=indented>So what is <i>aura</i>, for Benjamin?  It is, “[a] strange tissue of space and time: the unique apparition of a distance, however near it may be” (23).  To be clear, it was not the museum gallery that was giving off an aura, but rather, the paintings within the gallery.  Each one of them original representations of artistic genius that can never be recreated or replicated.  When Van Gogh painted <i>Irises</i>, each brush stroke was unique to that moment in 1889, and when that moment died, it died forever.  As such, each inch of that painting is a time-capsule containing greatness that once was, but could never be again.  Benjamin reminds us that today, the uniqueness of a historical painting becomes rarer and rarer, and thus more special.  Our world, which grows continually more and more technologically reproducible, has a dearth of such precious uniqueness in art.  Templates, photography, film, television, music, graphic design: all these modern modes of art are not only reproducible, but their reproducibility is their art.  To photograph something, for example, is to reproduce a moment in space and time, and that reproduction itself <i>is the art</i>, which in turn will be mass circulated.  As such, when we stand face-to-face with a unique and original work like <i>Irises</i>, its aura lands that much more potently with us as spectators.  This is why I and those around me were stupefied in its presence.</p>

<p class=indented>But Benjamin is not merely commenting on phenomenological accounts of experiencing art.  Instead, he is using that phenomenology to illuminate political reality.  For Benjamin, an artwork’s aura, “...bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject” (21).  As I said, each brush stroke of <i>Irises</i> was a verb locked in time, 1889, to be precise.  As such, the painting encapsulates a piece of 1889 itself.  Thus, we have history at our fingertips, even if we can’t touch it.  And indeed, this is <i>why</i> we cannot touch it, because to do so would defile the piece of history and its aura with the insignificant skin oils of today.  What we have in Irises, and the other paintings in that room is an auratic <i>physical embodiment</i> of the late 19th century.</p>

<p class=indented>As Benjamin points out and I exemplify with my tone and perception, this auratic nature puts rose-colored glasses on history itself.  Remember that the painting is a physical embodiment of history, yet, we treat that embodiment as ceremoniously sacred as if it were the ark of the covenant.  Thus, we associate that history with awe and rapturous majesty.  Seen this way, history, the world of the past, is no longer a brutish and lamentable existence.  It can no longer be seen for what it was: an archaic set of Hegelian <i>aufhebens</i>. Instead, it becomes an ethereal dreamland of utopia and ardor.  In other words, seen through an auratic lexicon, in history, we have already reached our desired socio-political destination, which in turn confuses our perception of the present.  Under this disillusionment of aura, we as a social corpus are straight-jacketed, because, “...this mode of reception gives the masses no means of organizing and regulating their response” (36).  How can we politically engage with our present, if we don’t know where the present relates to its history?  But as I left that room starry-eyed and intoxicated, I stepped downstairs into the photography exhibit, and when I did, I crossed a historical-technological rubicon that for Benjamin, would shake me out of my historical-political stupor (19-20).</p>

<p class=indented>This is because photography is less auratic than historical paintings.  Indeed, I have felt this truth ever since my first visits to the Getty as a schoolboy.  In my experience,  the Center for Photographs was nothing more than the center for yawns, likely because I had never, “ask[ed] the more fundamental question of whether the invention of photography had not transformed the entire character of art…” (28).  It is with these low expectations that I entered the photography gallery.  I glanced at the entranceway informing me that the exhibit was on Oscar Rejlander.  This name carried with it a complete absence of aura, but nonetheless, I carried on.  The room was poorly lit and large.  The first wall I looked at had a photograph of Rejlander’s wife—I yawned.  I next saw some cliché photos of nude models—my eyes glazed over.  It was starting to feel like one of those occasions where one feigns interest out of respect to some unknown ideal principle.  Then from the poorly lit room, I saw an entryway into a small,  slightly better-lit room.  I entered.  More nudes.  More yawns.</p>

<p class=indented>But then, again on the back wall, I saw something intriguing.  I don’t recall why it caught my eye, but it certainly wasn’t aura—it was something else.  It was a photograph, but this photograph was different.  It was a scene—a montage.  The photo had a dynamic depth and width.  About two-dozen or more subjects strewn about in what can only be described as orderly chaos.  Yes, there were more bare breasts, but there were also people clothed.  People laying on the ground, sitting, and standing.  Mild captivation and the thirst for more crept into my mind.  I wasn’t experiencing the auratic cult value of the paintings, but instead, I was experiencing exhibition value—value in perception alone.  This is because, “[i]n photography, exhibition value begins to drive back cult value on all fronts” (27).  The aura that derived from the cult value of historical paintings gives way to a more clear-headed and phenomenological exhibition value of photographs.  As such, photographs, “...unsettle the viewer; he feels challenged to find a particular way to approach them” (27).  It had “become obligatory,” for me to find the description, and I did (27).</p>

<p class=indented>This description informed me that the piece was titled, <i>The Two Ways of Life</i>.  It depicted two young men on either side of an old sage.  The young man to the viewers left was jerking like an uncontrollable chariot horse towards a sinful and profane life before him, as depicted by a somewhat bacchanalian spectacle of nude women and debaucherous men.  The young man to the viewers right maintained composure like a noble chariot horse, his dignified chest opened towards a scene of divine virtue.  The sage, like a grappling charioteer, was worriedly focused on the nearly lost young man. The description explained that this was not just one photograph. Instead, it was a strategically arranged collage of over thirty negatives, each one focusing on a different character in the scene.  The result was a fluid and dynamic photography montage, that captured reality in a way that none of the paintings upstairs could have.  The spectacle was so tangible and vivid, but I knew (only because the description told me) that it was anything but fluid.  Instead, it was a carefully crafted and manicured scene.  Interestingly, right next to this photograph was an enlarged replicate, flying in the face of the paintings upstairs which could never be replicated (21).  Undeniably, what this piece lacked in aura, it made up for in palpability.</p>

<p class=indented>Benjamin wants to uncover why that is.  The short answer is that photography is an art form of technological reproducibility, and, “...the technological reproduction of artworks is something new,” when compared to the archaic cult-value artwork upstairs (20).  In the photograph, “[t]he finished film is the exact antithesis of a work created in a single stroke,” like the single strokes that once and forever created <i>Irises</i> (28).  Thus, the physical import of the piece washes away (22)<sup>2</sup>. Benjamin is highlighting how unlike the paintings of Van Gogh, which is a spontaneous and inescapably unique gesture, the photograph (and movie) is an orchestrated scene.  If Rejlander didn’t like a certain arrangement of negatives, all he had to do was readjust.  This stands in stark opposition to Van Gogh, who in no way can adjust a brush stroke once laid down.  The paintings are unique moments captured forever on a canvas, while a photograph or film-reel is a carefully arranged and edited scene or series of scenes.  This facet of photography and other technologically reproducible art forms, “...transformed the entire character of art (28).”  It replaced amazing aura with tractability over reality.</p>

<p class=indented>And again, this has political import for Benjamin.  Whereas we had previously been awe-struck and straight-jacketed by the aura of the historical painting, as it tinted our lexicon via rose-colored glasses, the opposite is true for the arts of technological reproduction.  For these art forms, we are shaken out of our stupor and given chisels with which to sculpt our reality.  We cease being spectators and become actors.  Technologically reproducible art, because of its ability to shape a moment in reality, reveals to us that our world is not complete, never has been complete, and can only be completed through creation in the present.  It, “...create[s] a demand whose hour of full satisfaction has not yet come” (38).  For Benjamin, “[t]hese defining developmental tendencies of [technologically reproducible] art can therefore contribute to the political struggle in ways that it would be a mistake to underestimate” (19-20).  Indeed, under these technological advancements, “...the whole social function of art is revolutionized.  Instead of being founded on ritual, it is based on a different practice: politics” (25).  Again, why?  Because politics is the vehicle for change via rearrangement and restructuring.  Technological reproducible art forms, like photography and film, artistically exemplify and demonstrate this restructuring process.  Thus, “<i>...they are useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art</i>” (20).</p>

<p class=indented>According to Benjamin, what intrigued me most about The <i>Two Ways of Life</i>, was not its unique and original spatiotemporal qualities but rather, its structured, real-life qualities, that, for a moment at least, allowed my world to blend with its, and in that blending, my world realized the same plastic quality that the photograph realized.  “<i>The most important social function of film is to establish equilibrium between human beings and the apparatus</i>” (37)<sup>3</sup>.  Of course, he considered this process to be a mostly subconscious one, but for him, it is in the subconscious where spatiotemporal realities are at their most vulnerable to re-evaluation (37).  I actually didn’t want to leave that back wall, but I knew I had to eventually, lest I turn into Lot’s wife upstairs.</p>

<p class=indented>It was time for me to get going, but I fancied a stop at the gift shop on my way out.  I enjoyed the Manet, Monet, and Rejlander pieces so much, I wanted them for myself—at least a copy.  I found the first two, but not the Rejlander, and as I type right now, the Manet and the Monet prints stare at me on an adjacent wall in my bedroom.  I wanted to get closer to the art, I wanted to get closer to the world.  But in the end, it was <i>The Two Ways of Life</i> that afforded me that closeness, and the only thing the prints on my wall can afford me is eye candy and a portal to a good memory.</p>

I would be remiss if I didn’t clarify that here, Benjamin is referring to cinema as the true antithesis to auratic art, but I'm focusing on photography, which is the technological precursor to film, and thus, all important attributes of cinema apply to photography, just in a less mature form.
